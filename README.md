# Final-Project
Simple Idealized Generic Bacteria Growth Model
The growth rates of bacteria vary vastly, I used a generic 'bacteria' as a placer.  In the future one could add a specific type of bacteria with a known growth rate, for now I kept them randomish.  The model shows a hypothetical growth per day in 'add or remove bacteria'  Each bacteria is given an individual number that appears to the right when it dies. The final message gives the age of the culture in hours and multiplication count.
